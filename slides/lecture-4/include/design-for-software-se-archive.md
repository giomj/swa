# Quick recap

# Security Analysis during Design

## Start with a Data-flow perspective
- **Most attacks come through .red[data]**
- **Attacks gravitate towards .red[data]**

--
- Control flow: less relevant  
to analyze security in design and architecture

---
class: middle
# Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- A structured, concrete artifact to _discuss_ design:  
Conceptualization, Changes or Re-design
- Keeps designer focused on design issues

--
- **Practical Relevance**: _"Applying a structured approach to threat scenarios during design helps a team more effectively and less expensively identify security vulnerabilities, determine risks from those threats, and establish appropriate mitigations"_ [Microsoft SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/SDL/process/design.aspx)

# Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

## DFDs are visual representations of .red[**data flows**] through components of a software program
- Components of a software program:  
.green[Data Source] &#8594; .orange[Data Transformations] &#8594; .red[Data Sink]
- All control flows are abstracted into _processes_  
that perform data transformations

???

- Data flows provide a significantly simple system/software view when compare to control flow.

## DFD Level 1 Example

![example](images/dfd.png)

---
# DFD Levels

## Levels are hierarchically related
### Based on the granularity of the processes
- .red[**Level 0:**] Single process represents the whole system  
Very high-level; entire component / product / system.  
Show how the system interacts with the outside world.
- .red[**Level 1:**] Major processes and data stores identified   
High level; single feature / scenario
- .red[**Level 2:**] Detailed subcomponents of processes  
Low level; detailed features of a single feature / scenario
- ...

---
class: middle

# DFD Construction

## Step 1
### Start with a Level 0 diagram for a use case
- A single process (represents the system, no data stores)
- Identify all External Interactors (EI)
- Draw data flows to connect EI & the process
---

# Playsound API

"_The PlaySound API takes as input a string which represents either a WAV filename or an alias.  If the input is an alias, the PlaySound API retrieves data from the registry under HKCU to convert the alias into a filename.  Once the filename is determined, the PlaySound API opens the WAV file specified and reads the two relevant pieces from the file: the WAVEFORMATEX that defines the type of data in the file and the actual audio data.  It then hands that data to the audio rendering APIs._"

## Develop a Level 0 DFD*

.footnote[*_[Class exercise](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dYBlbTcs3fBs-hawHgdJjL2xGrOFnrSOVpsB2pTGHNc/edit?usp=sharing)_]

---

class: middle
# DFD Construction
## Step 2
### Transition to a Level 1 diagram
- Breakdown the single Level 0 process into major processes and related data stores .red[for a single feature / scenario]
- Check your work
- Can you tell a story without edits?
- Does it match reality?

---
class: middle
# DFD Construction
## Step 3
### Add trust boundaries that intersect data flows
### Trust boundary placement
- Threads are often inside a trust boundary.   
They share the same privileges, rights, identifiers and access    


- Processes talking across a network may create a secure channel, but .red[they’re still distinct entities.]   

---
class: middle
# DFD Construction
## Step 4
### Iterate over processes and data stores
- Break them down if more detail needed to explain .red[_security impact of the design_]


- Break them down if an object crosses a trust boundary. For example, a remote procedural call (RPC)


- Break them down if you use words like “sometimes” and “also” in your story

---
class: middle
# DFD Construction
## Step 5: Check the diagram for sanity (1)
### Data stores
- Two data stores should not be connected with data flows directly. They are static entities.
- External interactors should not directly interact with data stores. Their data representation formats are different.
- Data stores should have an input flow
- Try to locate data sinks, whenever possible

### Data Flows
- Attached to at least one process or EI


---
# DFD Construction
## Step 5: Check the diagram for sanity (2)
### External Interactors
- Avoid data flows between External Interactors. They cannot be observed by the system.
- Data always comes from External Interactors.

### Processes
- Carefully think about direct dataflows between two separate processes on a single machine.   
Use intermediate data stores such as message queues or domain sockets.
---
# DFD Construction
## Step 6
### Simplify
- Consolidate data flows that always flow together


- All processes need appropriate _inputs_ to generate _outputs_. No outputs without inputs!


- Avoid partitioning processes based on control logic.  
Partition processes that perform multiple functions and they exist in different process spaces.


- DFDs do not typically show time dependencies.   
If processes can communicate directly they are assumed to be synchronous!
---
class: middle
# DFD Modeling Summary
- DFDs depict data flows from sources to sinks with transformations along the way.   
Trust boundaries intersecting these data flows.


- Hierarchical structuring (Levels) allows system analysis at different levels of abstraction

# Observations and Reflections

## Expensive (Time)
- Too many threats to analyze! (even for small diagrams)

## Redundancy
- Redundant threats when analyzed individually

## How can we make this more efficient?
---
class: middle

# STRIDE with DFDs (Per .red[Interaction])
## Focus on Interactions
- Interaction:   
A source and target element connected by a data flow
---
class: middle

# STRIDE with DFDs (Per .red[Interaction])
## Efficiencies and Savings
- For each interactions apply STRIDE
- For each STRIDE threat identify the attacker controlled element and the attacked element
- For data flows inside a .red[single] process space,   
don’t worry about T, I, or D
- Prioritize interactions that cross trust boundaries
???
## Significant reduction in number of threats to be analyzed
---
class: middle

# Trust boundaries
## Trusted/high code reading from untrusted/low
- Look for Tampering threats

## High code writing to low
- Errors may result in Information Disclosure
---
class: middle

# Avoid Distractions
## Applications can't do much here:
- The computer is infected with malware
- Someone removed the hard drive and tampers
- Admin is attacking user
- A user is attacking himself

## Applications can’t address any of these   
(unless you’re the OS)

## Automation
- Much of this analysis can be automated using simple rules based on the diagram structure
- Tool support

## Traceability
- Would be nice to link all analysis along with the diagram
- A bit more than a PPT, Visio or Lucidchart!

---
class: middle
# Threat Mitigations
## Four ways to address each threat
1. Redesign to eliminate
1. Apply standard mitigations  
What have similar software packages done and how has that worked out for them?
1. Invent new mitigations (.red[risky!])
1. Accept vulnerability in design  
Risk acceptable, but must be verified and approved

class: middle
# Standard Mitigations

## Elevation of Privilege
- Input validation

---
# How to ignore threats?
## No requirement
- There are no requirements that the &lt;&lt;element&gt;&gt; protect against &lt;&lt;STRIDE&gt;&gt; threat

## Irrelevant
- This threat does not exist, so we don't care about &lt;&lt;STRIDE&gt;&gt; threat to the &lt;&lt;element&gt;&gt;

## Not applicable
- &lt;&lt;STRIDE&gt;&gt; threat does not apply to this &lt;&lt;element&gt;&gt;
---
class: middle
# Validate the Threat Model

1. Do the threats consider misuse cases?
1. Does the diagram match final code?
1. Are enough threats enumerated?
1. Has Test / QA reviewed the model?
Testers often finds issues with threat model or missing details
1. Is each threat mitigated?
1. Are mitigations done right?  (Assurance case, possibly)
