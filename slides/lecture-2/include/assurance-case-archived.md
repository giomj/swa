What are the Goals/Claims to be proven?
]
- Operational tasks may not focus on outcomes.
- Assurance is in context of a claim.

# Possible claims

### .red[Claim 1:] The room has at least one black cat
--

### .red[Claim 2:] The room has no black cats

### .blue[
What is the basis for the belief in these claims?
]
---
class: middle
# .red[Claim 1]
The room has at least one black cat

---
class: middle
# Basis for the Belief

## .blue[Kitty-Kitty-Kitty] Search Process*
1. Search team puts a bowl of milk in the room and says  
.green[_kitty-kitty-kitty_] three times
1. Four corners and center of room covered
1. Stop when a cat is discovered

.footnote[\* Patent Pending]

# Structured Argument
### .red[Claim]
.red[C1:] The room has at least one black cat
--

### .red[Sub-Claims]
.red[C1.1:] Kitty-kitty-kitty search process discovers cats in the room

--

### .red[Evidence]

.red[E1.1.1:] Pictures of cats found

class: middle
# .red[Claim 2]
The room has .red[no] black cats

--

### .red[Sub-Claims]
.red[C1.1:] Kitty-kitty-kitty search process discovers no cats

--
### .red[Evidence]

.red[E1.1.1:] Empty findings report

class: middle
# Is this argument enough?
Can you ever be 100% sure for a large and complex room?  


---
class: middle
# .red[Assurance]
Basis for the belief in a claim

--

.green[Belief] increases when .red[doubts] are removed!   

--

A good argument eliminates identified doubts

---

class: middle
# [Eliminative Induction](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+eliminative+induction)
A series of doubts are introduced for some state of affairs,  
and then progressively eliminated by new evidence

---
# Eliminative Induction

## Step 1: Introduce doubts
Challenge the identified claims by introducing doubts
--

## Step 2: Eliminate doubts
For each doubt, identify sub-claims that eliminate the doubt
--

## Step 3: Evaluate Argument
Can sub-claims be directly supported by evidence?
If not, go to Step 1, repeat process for sub-claims
---
class: middle
# Step 1: Introduce doubts

.red[C1.1:] Kitty-kitty-kitty search process discovers no cats
--

* .red[R1.1.1] _Unless_ the cats were not hungry  
* .red[R1.1.2] _Unless_ milk is not put in enough places
* .red[R1.1.3] _Unless_ the people searching are not competent
* .red[R1.1.4] _Unless_ the baby panthers found are indeed cats

---
class: middle
# Step 2: Eliminate doubts

.red[R1.1.1] Unless the cats were not hungry   
* .green[C1.1.1] The room was locked for 5 days  

--

.red[R1.1.2] Unless milk is not put in enough places  
* .green[C1.1.2] The room is simultaneously searched in 10 equal non-overlapping squares  

---
class: middle
# Step 3: Evaluate --> STOP or Step 1: Identify doubts

.green[C1.1.1] The room was locked for 5 days  
* .red[R1.1.1.1] Unless the room vents allow cats to go in and out  

--

.green[C1.1.2] The room is simultaneously searched in 10 equal non-overlapping squares  
* .red[R1.1.1.2] Unless the cats have an alternate food supply (mice in the room)

---
class: middle
# Step 2: Eliminate doubts

.red[R1.1.1.1] Unless the room vents allow cats to go in and out  
* .green[C1.1.1.1.1] All room vents have nets installed

--

.red[R1.1.1.2] Unless the cats have an alternate food supply (mice in the room)
* .green[C1.1.1.1.2] There are no mice in the room

---
class: middle
# Stopping condition?

## Evidence
When the argument is convincing enough to the reader, it should end in the presentation of .blue[_facts_] that support the .green[_claims_]

---
class: middle
# Evidence

.red[R1.1.1.1] Unless the room vents allow cats to go in and out  
* .green[C1.1.1.1.1] All room vents have nets installed
* .blue[E1.1.1.1.1 Vent inspection report]

.red[Unless] the cats have an alternate food supply (mice in the room)
* .green[C1.1.1.1.2] There are no mice in the room
* .blue[E1.1.1.1.2 Month old exterminator report for rodents]

---
class: middle
# Argument and Evidence
* Without argument, evidence is irrelevant.
* Without evidence the argument is not substantiated.

---

class: middle
# Basis for the Belief

As more reasons for doubt are eliminated, assurance in the top-level claim increases  

If many doubts remain, assurance is diminished

--

A rigorous argumentation structure assists .red[*trust decisions*] for the presented claims
---

class: middle
# .red[Claim 3]
The room will have .red[no] black cats for the .red[next 12 months]

--

Does it make sense to justify this claim by a single search at a moment in time?

---
class: middle
# Risk: A future adverse event

We can introduce even more doubts!
* .red[R1.1.5] Unless the cats hibernate when search is conducted  
* .red[R1.1.6] Unless cat zapper vents are working intermittently
* .red[R1.1.7] Unless the vents are not being inspected periodically
* .red[R1.1.8] Unless the exterminator skips visits

--

To eliminate these doubts, .green[continuous] efforts are required.

# Convince a bystander

### _While an assurance case is useful for decision-making by knowledgeable stakeholders (e.g., developers and service providers), often the primary motivation for an assurance case is to support crucial decisions by stakeholders without this background, such as those involved in certification, regulation, acquisition, or audit of the system._

# Claims Matter!
### Claims concern critical properties

--

### A claim is always worded as a predicate
- i.e. it can only be true or false

--

### Avoid claims about the supporting method/techniques
- .red[Bad claim:] The system uses AES encryption
- Why? Because it is not interesting

--

### Claim should be a reasonable goal (outcome)
- .green[Good claim:] “The system is acceptably secure against communication lines related threats”

???

## Good claims
- These say something about expected outcomes we really wish for by using security technologies or by performing security-related activities
- Claims about expected outcomes can be argued extensively

- E.g. "AES encryption" (security technology) --> "secure against communication line related threats" (outcome we try wish for)
---
# Claims Matter!

## Claim properties are risk-related
- High confidence is needed in their realization

--

## Good Claim Checklist
- .blue[An entity]
- .orange[A critical property of the entity]
- .green[A value for the property and related uncertainty]

--

## Example
- .blue[The system] .green[is acceptably] .orange[secure]
- .blue[The system] .green[has no] .orange[unacceptable consequences to assets from security threats]

---
class: middle
# [Grammatical Guidance](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/dependability/tools/assurancecase/)

## .blue[&lt;NOUN-PHRASE&gt;]
- .blue[Noun-Phrase] identifies the subject (“entity”) of the claim

## .orange[&lt;VERB-PHRASE&gt;]  
- .orange[Verb-Phrase] defines a predicate using the critical property of the subject along with its expected value and related uncertainty

## Consider [diagramming sentences](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/diagrams2/one_pager1.htm)
- Avoid compound predicates

---
class: middle
# [Grammatical Guidance](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/dependability/tools/assurancecase/)

## Bad Examples
- Just describes an entity: ~~.red[XSS results for Canvas]~~
- Describes an action on entity: ~~.red[Perform XSS on Canvas]~~
- A question: ~~.red[How many XSS weaknesses does Canvas have?]~~
- Fact, no argument needed: .red[~~Canvas uses AES encryption~~]

## Examples
- External references, Definitions, Clarification of myths
- Security considerations for supply chain processes per NIST SP 800-160

---
class: middle
# Justification

## Provides .red[rationale] for the use/selection of a claim or strategy

## Example
- Intelligence reports of malicious code in nuclear energy software

---
class: middle

# Assurance Cases in Practice

## CC Evaluations and Software Assurance
- Argue how protection profile needs are satisfied by a Security Target
- Assurance cases are recommended for the highest levels of Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL)
